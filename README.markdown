# GameKitP2P

## Features
Using Apple's GameKit framework, the application both advertises itself on the 
local network and automatically connects to other application instances, 
establishing a peer-to-peer network.

You'll need at least two iOS devices to set up a network. Build the application using 
Xcode and run it on the device. Wait for another iOS device running the application to 
join the network.

## BUILD REQUIREMENTS:

Mac OS X 10.6.4, iOS 4.1 SDK
