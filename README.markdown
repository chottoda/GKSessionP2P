## GKSessionP2P
A demo app that illustrates the ad-hoc networking features of iOS GKSession. The app both advertises itself 
on the local network and automatically connects to available peers, establishing a peer-to-peer network.

You'll need to run at least two instances of the app to set up a P2P network. Build the application using 
Xcode and run it on a device or the simulator. Wait for another application instance to join the network. 
Devices / simulators must be on the same network or within Bluetooth range to see each other. Connected 
peers will appear in the peer list.

## Build requirements:
iOS 5 SDK (Objective-C ARC enabled)

## Runtime requirements:
iOS 4.0
